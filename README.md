# Pong, written in Monogame

This is mainly a learning experience for me, to improve my understanding of the Monogame framework.
I am following a [tutorial by HadiCya](https://hadicya.dev/building-pong-with-monogame-a-step-by-step-guide).
They have posted [their code](https://github.com/HadiCya/Pong-MonoGame) on github as well.
